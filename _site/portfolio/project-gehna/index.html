    <p>Jewelry weaves into our everyday lives as no other wearable does. It comes in many wearable forms, is fashionable, and can adorn any part of the body. In this paper, through an exploratory, research-through-design process, we tap into this vast potential space of input interaction that jewelry can enable. We do so by first identifying a small set of fundamental structural elements — called Jewelements — that any jewelry is composed of, and then defining their properties that enable the interaction. We leverage this synthesis along with observational data and literature to formulate a design space of jewelry-enabled input techniques. This framework encapsulates both the extensions of common existing input methods (e.g., touch) as well as a few new ones inspired by jewelry. Furthermore, we discuss our prototypical sensor-based implementations. Through this work, we invite the community to engage in the conversation on how jewelry as a “material” can help shape wearable-based input.</p>

<!-- To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so: 

	---
	layout: post
	title: Project
	description: a project with a background image
	img: /img/12.jpg
	---
 -->

<!-- <div class="img_row">
	<img class="col one" src="/img/1.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="/img/2.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="/img/3.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.
</div> -->

<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col three" src="/img/banner-gehna.png" alt="" title="example image" />
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	These are some of the day-to-day interactions that Jewelry enables

<p>This work has been conditionally accepted in CHI’2019. See you in Glasgow!

<!-- You can also put regular text between your rows of images. Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images. You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then.... you reveal it's glory in the next row of images.


<div class="img_row">
	<img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
	<img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg" alt="" title="example image"/>
</div>
<div class="col three caption">
	You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


<br/><br/><br/>


The code is simple. Just add a col class to your image, and another class specifying the width: one, two, or three columns wide. Here's the code for the last row of images above: 

	<div class="img_row">
	  <img class="col two" src="/img/6.jpg"/>
	  <img class="col one" src="/img/11.jpg"/>
	</div>
